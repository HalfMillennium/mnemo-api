# Mnemo API

The Mnemo API is a Django-based Python service that generates first-person POV journal entries for any entity that a user might be curious about.

By entity, I mean literally anything - Taylor Swift, John Travolta, Fred Armisen; But also, users can search for "mail man" or "frog", and some kind of journal entry will be generated for them. Though, to be honest, I can't assure you that those will be entertaining to read!

Any entity can have a maximum of one diary entry associated with it per day.

## How?

The entries are generated by ChatGPT via OpenAI's Python library, based on relevant current events and historical information that is currently floating around about any given entity. These results are delivered to interested clients through a GraphQL server built with Django + Graphene (with containerization w/ Docker).

## Why?

The purpose of the Mnemo API is to serve its only current client, which is the Mnemo app (see my other repository [HERE](https://github.com/HalfMillennium/mnemo-app)).
